# Installation Instructions

Install via ComfyUI-Manager or go to the custom_nodes/ directory and run ```$ git clone https://github.com/lquesada/ComfyUI-Prompt-Combinator.git```

# Detailed Use Case
You want to produce all possible combinations of prompts from several lists of strings, e.g.

**Input list 1:**
```
a cat
a dog
```

**Input list 2:**
```
with pointy ears
with fluffy tail
with two heads
```

**Input list 3:**
```
cute
scary
```

**Expected output:** a list of strings that contain
```
a cat
with pointy ears
cute

a cat
with pointy ears
scary

a cat
with fluffy tail
cute

a cat
with fluffy tail
scary

a cat
with two heads
cute

a cat
with two heads
scary

a dog
with pointy ears
cute

a dog
with pointy ears
scary

a dog
with fluffy tail
cute

a dog
with fluffy tail
scary

a dog
with two heads
cute

a dog
with two heads
scary
```

Additionally, you may want to be able to identify what inputs were used in order to craft the filename_prefix, e.g.:
cat, pointy-ears, scary_00001_.png
dog, two-heads, cute_00001_.png

This custom node serves this purpose.
